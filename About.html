        <h3>Professionally</h3>
    <p>I am currently striving to grow in the world of cartography and GIS. I have always had a passion for finding the truth in data and being able to represent that truth graphically. I am a strong problem solver and I derive motivation and energy from critical thinking. </p>
        <p>In my undergraduate career I completed two B.S. degrees at the University of Wisconsin Madison in Philosophy (focused on philosophy of science) and in Environmental Science (focused on mapping air quality data). I entered the work world in renewable energy after graduation and put my skills to the test. After a year of work-experience, I knew that the mapping work I had done was what stimulated me most and I chose to pursue it building on those skills.</p>
        <p> I currently work as a GIS Technician and I am concurrently completing a master's degree with the University of Wisconsin Madison in GIS Web Map Programming. I am extremely excited to be constantly learning and growing in this field!</p>
        
        <h3>Recreational</h3>
          <p>I have been steeped in the worl of outdoor adventure since I was very young. I am thankful for that and it has led me to many fullfilling experiences. I am an avid rock climber (in case my content didn't tip you off to that already), but I also take the time to enjoy running, skiing, hiking with friends and family. I spend lots of time travelling to climb and I help out at some of the local climbing gyms.</p>
        <p>Music is a strong passion of mine. I spend lots of time collecting and listening to my favorite music. I also dabble in creating a little music of my own! </p>
